# Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- jQuery
- Materialize 

# Future Enhancements 
- I would really like to add a few extra pages that have been linked together to create a known alias page or possibly even another modal to display this information
- The known alias page would just be other verisons of that character from different dimensions and would have their name and an image of them 
- Create a function to make a random number generater in the modal for a bounty price
